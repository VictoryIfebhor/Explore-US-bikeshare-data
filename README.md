This is my solution to the Udacity Explore US bikeshare data.

Using python, I was able to write a script that can be used to access and filter information for the bikeshare system in chicago, new york city and washington.

The programme will allow users to either view all data or view specific sections of interest.

The CSV files containing the data set has been provided as well.

I did this as a project and have chosen to share my code. I hope it helps
